This utility allows non-super users to restart apache2 if they belong to the deployers group. This is accomplished by by the makefile setting ownerships and suid bit during installation.

The utility also allows authorized users to check the syntax of apache configuration files using apache2ctl configtest. This test is also ran before restarting apache, and the utility will refuse to restart apache if any configuration files have syntax errors. This avoids the default apache restart behavior that shuts apache down before checking config files and is unable to restart apache if any config file has an error.

You can change the name of the deployers group by editing the make file.
